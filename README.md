# Goal

The idea is to attempt to solve ARC using a vision-based approach. We'll first bench vision models for their vision reasoning abilities on ARC, and then attempt to train a visual "reasoning" model that is able to reason on the task somehow visually, using spatial arrangements in some useful way that we've encoded.
