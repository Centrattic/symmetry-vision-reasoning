Response:
To construct the final output grid by picking the height and width of the input grid such that the final empty grid is black and contain symbols (integer values between 0 and 9), only exact solutions are correct.

1. First, ensure that the black box contains 0.
2. Second, pick a height of 2, meaning the total height becomes 4 (excluding 0).
3. Third, pick a width of 2 (excluding 0), creating a total width of 4 when all cells are filled.

Final output grid:
Top row: [0]
Right row: [0]
Bottom row: [0]
Left row: [4]
