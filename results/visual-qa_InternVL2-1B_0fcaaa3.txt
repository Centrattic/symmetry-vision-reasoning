Response:
To map the input grid to the output grid, we start by checking the general structure of the grid.

1. The first row (top row) has four rectangles: 1, 2, 3, and 10 as symbols.
2. The first column (left column) has three cells: 1, 2, and 5.
3. The top left cell (vertical and horizontal) has a purple color, and the other cells are blue.

Applying this visualization to the grid, the output grid will have corresponding visual icons:

- Top and bottom cells' colors represented by 1 and 10.

The next row needs to calculate further symbols. Checking each possible set of colors and patterns available, let's take:
- From the top row:

1. Blue and red can occupy this space to fill any of the three cells at their respective top-left corners.
Let's assume we choose blue for the top right and red for the top left:
- The first cell is filled in blue.
- The second cell is filled in red.
Thus, the filled cells are filled by blue and red.

For the other sides:
1. Blue: 1, 4, 3, ... (from other bottom-left cell onwards)
2. Red: 1, 3, 5, ... (from bottom-right cell onwards)
Thus, we assume these for any other cell's color patterns to make the patterns of their corresponding symbol.
The last three cells represent a similar general pattern for the output grid.

Thus, finally to get it correct:

# Output Grid:
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 10 |  |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 4 | 9 | --- | --- |--- | ---
| 3 | 5 | --- | 1 | --- |--- |
| 5 | --- | 3 | --- | --- |--- |
| 10 | --- |  | 1 | --- |--- |
| 1 | 4 | 3 | --- | --- |--- | ---
| 5 | --- | 3 | --- | 3 | 4 |
| 9 | --- | --- | 3 |  | 2 |
| 3 | 5 | 1 | --- | --- |--- |
| 1 | 9 | 5 | --- | --- |--- |
| 10 | --- | --- | 1 | --- |--- |
| 1 | 9 | --- | --- | 3 | 5 |

To map these patterns to an empty grid, the output is:
```
[[
[1, 7],
[2, 8],
[3, 7],
[[0, 0],
[6, 0], [8, 0], [6, 0],
[[7, 7],
 [0, 8],
[3, 8],
[[0, 5],
[6, 6], [8, 7], [6, 7], [0, 7]]
[[4, 6],
[7, 8]]
[[8, 9], [7, 3], [6, 5], [7, 2], [8, 9]]
]]);
```

This grid is visually explained as:
```
1 7
7
8
...
0 4
4 9
9 2
...
5 3
4 5
3 1
...
6 6
6
...
1 0
9 10
... 4
9 5
... 3
...
3 3
.... 5 
5 2
... 8
8 1
...
7 5
5
...
1 6
6 8
...
0 2
```

This mapping will make the visualization of colors as exact as possible, and it provides clear instructions as to what each column in the grid would symbolize. The output grid is ````[ [[1, 7], [2, 8]], [[3, 7], [[0, 0], #], [8, 0], #], #[[7, 7], #]] [[4, 6], #[[7, 8]]] [[8, 9], [] [[7, 3], #[[8, 7], #[[6, 7], #[[2, 7], #[[1, 7], #[[3, 7], #[[5, 7]]]]][1], #[[8, 9], #[[7, 3], #[[8, 7], #[[6, 7], #[[2, 7], #[[1, 7]]]]][1], #[[8, 9], #[[7, 3], #[[8, 7
