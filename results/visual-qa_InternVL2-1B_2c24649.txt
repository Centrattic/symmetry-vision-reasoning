Response:
To construct an output grid from the given logic problem, follow these steps:

### Transformations Overview:
1. **Vertical Transitions (Top to Bottom)**:
    - Change from a red box to a black top.
        - Output: (blue, black, red, top, black, blue, black, top)

2. **Horizontal Transitions (Left to Right)**:
    - Change from a red box to a black left.
        - Output: (blue, black, black, left, red, blue, black, top)

### Grid Builder:
1. **Vertical Transformation**: Start from the top box and move vertically down. For an output, the grid should start with:
        - (blue, black, top)

2. **Horizontal Transformation**: Start from the left box and move horizontally left. For an output, the grid should start with:
        - (blue, black, top, left)

### Grid Output Grid Builder:
1. **Vertical Grid (Top to Bottom)**:
    - For the top box:
    ```
     [ (8,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5) ]
    ```
    - For the bottom box:
    ```
     [ (8,1), (7,2), (6,3), 8, 7, 8 ]
    ```
2. **Horizontal Grid (Left to Right)**:
    - For the leftmost box:
    ```
     [ (0,7), (1,8), (2,9), 0, 6, 2]
    ```
    - Move horizontally using the transition from 'black' to 'top':
    ```
     [ (0,8), (1,9), (2,0), 0, 6, 0]
    ```
Adding vertical and horizontal grid patterns to create the final grid

### Final Output Grid:
- Grid 1:
  ```
  [ (2,1), (1,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,1), (2,0), (1,1), (1,0), (2,1), (2,0), (1,0), (1,0), (2,1), (2,0), (1,1), (1,0), (2,1), (2,0) ]
  ```
  
- Grid 2:
  ```
  [ (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,0), (0,0), (1,1), (0,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,1), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0) ]
  ```
  
These patterns are exact representations of the provided logical problem examples and outputs. You can use this to construct the final output grid step-by-step.
### Implementation:
```
[[2,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0], [0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1]]
[[1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1]]
[[0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]]
