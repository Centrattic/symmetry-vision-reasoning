Response:
To solve the image, we need to find the exact grid transformation that produces an empty grid. This transformation involves picking a height and a width, then filling the grid with symbols from 0 to 9, visualized as colored squares.

We can observe the image where:

- Two rows of alternating colors (1 dark and 2 light) meet at the top and bottom without a filled cells.

To create the final output grid, we must carefully follow the pattern. We start with the bottom left rectangle (height, width) filled with a 1 in dark color from the top-left corner, then follow the pattern of selecting the width and height for each color to fill the rest of the grid.

Following the pattern, we go like this:

**Top** Row:
- The first color fills from left to right.
- The second color fills from right to left.

**Bottom Row**:
- The first color fills from top to bottom.
- The second color fills from left to right.

Following these steps, we can deduce that the only possibility is to:
1. Select a horizontal cell with width 3 and a height of 2.
2. Select another horizontal cell with width 2 and a height of 2.

2. Select a horizontal cell with width 3 and a height of 3.
3. Select another similar 3x3 cell. The 16th square from the top-left (with a height of 2, width 5) would fit.
4. The other square is in a different region (since the final pattern would be in the bottom right, which isn't shown in this pattern).

So, the final grid after selecting the options:

1. Top row: 1. Dark, 2. White, 3. Black
2. Bottom row: 2. Dark, 3. White, 4. Black, 5. White, 6. Black (top-left filled)
3. Top-left cell (7. 1. Dark, 1. White, 8. Black)
4. Third row (10. Dark, 9. White, 11. Black)
