Response:
To map the image to the grid provided, we have two scenarios:

1. A set of four scenarios with black backgrounds.
2. An empty black box.

Here's how we can approach each scenario:

### Scenario 1: Black Background with 4 Input Grids (Four Black Bars with Different Heights)
For a scenario with four input grids, each grid would have height 2. The weights of the input bars for the output grids would be based on the input bars used. Let's assume the input bar weights in each row are 1, 2, and 3; each column is 1, 2, and 3 as well.

So, we might start by putting the first bar in the top center position, then the second one in the bottom center, and so on, until reaching the bottom left:

- For height 2: 
  - Top: (1 + 2) so 3
  - Middle: (2 + 2) so 4
  - Bottom: (3 + 2) so 5
  
- For height greater than 2: We can pick higher bars to fit different heights.

### Scenario 2: Empty Black Box
Given a perfectly empty black box, the answer will be [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2].

In conclusion, we can construct the output grid as:
- Top Row:
    - 3
    - 4
    - 5
    
- Second Row:
    - 4
    - 5

Overall, the answer is:
