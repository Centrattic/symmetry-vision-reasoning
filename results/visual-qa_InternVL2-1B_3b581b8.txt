Response:
To construct the final output grid, pick the height and width, and then fill each cell with a symbol from a visual color. Follow these steps:

1. Given the input grids for each stage, we start by analyzing the patterns to identify the transformations:
   - The input first has each color filled vertically.
   - The second stage repeats the same as the first stage, but the alignment changes.
   - The third stage shifts the blocks horizontally and vertically.

Assuming the patterns do not change and follow the transformation logic:
- The final grid should consist of numbers that make sense as inputs.
- The first block should remain as the topmost.
- The second should follow similar patterns.
- The third should align the blocks horizontally and vertically, thus maintaining block integrity.

Now, let's write a function to achieve this logic step-by-step:
```python
# Initial configurations
block_height = 2
block_width = 2

# Initial grids for different steps
grid_1 = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
grid_2 = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
grid_3 = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

# Function to fill each cell with a symbol
def fill_grid(row, col, symbol):
    grid[row][col] = symbol

# Phase 1: Initial block
grid = block_1
fill_grid(0, 0, 9)
fill_grid(0, 1, 7)
fill_grid(0, 2, 5)
fill_grid(1, 1, 6)
fill_grid(2, 2, 3)
fill_grid(3, 0, 7)
fill_grid(3, 1, 2)
fill_grid(3, 2, 0)

# Phase 2: Second row
grid[0][0] = 1  # New color in the first cell
fill_grid(0, 2, 3)
fill_grid(0, 3, 2)
fill_grid(0, 3, 1)
fill_grid(1, 0, 3)
fill_grid(1, 1, 2)
fill_grid(1, 2, 1)
fill_grid(2, 0, 3)
fill_grid(2, 1, 1)
fill_grid(2, 2, 3)
fill_grid(3, 0, 1)
fill_grid(3, 1, 2)
fill_grid(3, 2, 0)

# Phase 3: Third row
for j in range(0, grid_height):
    for i in range(0, block_width):
        grid[i][j] = grid[i].count(True)

# Phase 4: Color filling
for i in range(block_height):
    for j in range(0, block_width):
        grid[i][j] = 0

print(grid)
```

This code constructs an output grid based on the initial logic described above with each cell having a symbol associated with different numbers, filling from top to bottom and left to right.
