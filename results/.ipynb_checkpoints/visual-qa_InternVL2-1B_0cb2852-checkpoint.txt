Response:
To construct the final output grid, let's analyze the input grid to see its transformation. The input grid from the puzzle consists of different shapes like squares and rectangles, and it is shown in a 2x4 grid with two rows and one column. The transformation shown should maintain a consistent numerical pattern from the original input grid.

From the image:

- The top left rectangle is 10 (blue), 7 (blue), 6 (yellow).
- The top middle rectangle is 10 (blue), 9 (yellow), 2 (black).
- The top right rectangle is 10 (blue), 6 (yellow), 4 (black).
- The bottom left rectangle is 8 (red), 3 (yellow), 5 (blue).
- The bottom middle rectangle is 7 (red), 8 (yellow), 9 (black).
- The bottom right rectangle is 9 (blue), 1 (yellow), 1 (black).

Now, we will use these coordinates (height, width) and corresponding colors (visualized as colors) to fill each cell in the grid with the correct symbol from the original grid:

#### Height-wise
- Top left: Top left rectangle has a height of 1, and the corresponding symbol is 6 (blue). Top middle rectangle has a height of 2, and the corresponding symbol is 6 (yellow). Top right rectangle has a height of 4, and the corresponding symbol is 8 (yellow). Bottom left rectangle has a height of 8, and the corresponding symbol is 5 (blue).
- Top right: Top left rectangle has a height of 1, and the corresponding symbol is 7 (blue). Top middle rectangle has a height of 5, and the corresponding symbol is 7 (yellow). Top right rectangle has a height of 5, and the corresponding symbol is 4 (black). Bottom left rectangle has a height of 8, and the corresponding symbol is 5 (blue).
- Top middle: Top left rectangle has a height of 1, and the corresponding symbol is 8 (red). Top middle rectangle has a height of 7, and the corresponding symbol is 8 (yellow). Top right rectangle has a height of 5, and the corresponding symbol is 8 (black). Bottom left rectangle has a height of 8 (red), and the corresponding symbol is 5 (blue).
- Top right: Top left rectangle has a height of 1, and the corresponding symbol is 9 (blue). Top middle rectangle has a height of 2, and the corresponding symbol is 9 (yellow). Top right rectangle has a height of 6, and the corresponding symbol is 8 (black). Bottom left rectangle has a height of 8, and the corresponding symbol is 5 (blue).

#### Width-wise
- Top left: Top left rectangle has a width of 1 and the corresponding symbol is 6 (blue).
- Top middle: Top middle rectangle has a width of 1 and the corresponding symbol is 6 (yellow).
- Top right: Top left rectangle has a width of 1 and the corresponding symbol is 8 (yellow).
- Top right: Top middle rectangle has a width of 5 and the corresponding symbol is 7 (black).
- Top right: Top right rectangle has a width of 15 and the corresponding symbol is 4 (black).

Using the above analysis:
- **Top Left Rectangle**: Top left: 1, color: 6 (blue), symbol: 6 (yellow).
- **Top Middle Rectangle**: Top middle: 1, color: 6 (yellow), symbol: 6 (yellow).
- **Top Right Rectangle**: Top right: 4, color: 8 (yellow), symbol: 8 (yellow).
- **Bottom Left Rectangle**: Bottom left: 8, color: 5 (blue), symbol: 5 (red).
- **Bottom Middle Rectangle**: Bottom middle: 7, color: 7 (yellow), symbol: 7 (yellow).
- **Bottom Right Rectangle**: Bottom right: 8 (red), color: 9 (blue), symbol: 4 (black).

The final output grid should represent a simplified version of the puzzle input. The grid is empty, and all symbols are represented as colors and their associated width and height.

Final output grid:
```
6 6
1 8
2 8
4 8
7 7
9 4
```
