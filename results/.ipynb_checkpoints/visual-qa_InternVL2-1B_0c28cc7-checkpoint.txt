Response:
Yes, I can assist with creating the logic puzzle. Below is an example of how to create an output grid after applying the transformation to each input grid (integer values):

```javascript
const inputGrids = [
    // The first row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, first column is right (8)
    // The second row, second column is left (8)
    // The third row, first column is left (1)
    // The third row, second column is right (8)
    [0, 8, 8],
    // The first row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, first column is left (8)
    // The second row, second column is left (8)
    // The third row, first column is left (1)
    // The third row, second column is left (8)
    [8, 1, 8],
    // The first row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, first column is left (1)
    // The second row, second column is right (6)
    // The third row, first column is left (0)
    // The third row, second column is left (8)
    [8, 8, 8],
    // The first row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, first column is left (8)
    // The second row, second column is right (6)
    // The third row, first column is left (1)
    // The third row, second column is left (8)
    [8, 8, 8], // The third row, first column is left (1)
    // The first row, first column is right (8)
    // The second row, first column is left (8)
    // The second row, second column is left (8)
    // The third row, first column is left (1)
    // The third row, second column is right (8)
    [1, 8, 8],
    // The first row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, first column is left (1)
    // The second row, second column is left (8)
    // The third row, first column is left (1)
    // The third row, second column is right (8)
    [1, 8, 8],
    // The first row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, first column is left (8)
    // The second row, second column is left (0)
    // The third row, first column is left (8)
    // The third row, second column is right (8)
    [1, 8, 8],
    // The first row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, first column is left (8)
    // The second row, second column is left (8)
    // The third row, first column is left (0)
    // The third row, second column is right (8)
    [0, 8, 8],
    // The first row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, second column is left (8)
    // The third row, first column is left (6)
    // The third row, second column is left (8)
    [0, 8, 8],
    // The first row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, second column is right (4)
    // The third row, first column is left (6)
    // The third row, second column is left (8)
    [0, 8, 8],
    // The first row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, second column is left (4)
    // The third row, first column is left (0)
    // The third row, second column is right (8)
    [0, 8, 8],
    // The third row, first column is left (6)
    // The third row, first column is right (4)
    // The third row, second column is left (0)
    // The third row, second column is left (8)
    [0, 8, 8], // The fourth row, first column is left (0)
    // The first row, first column is left (0)
    // The second row, first column is left (8)
    // The second row, second column is right (5)
    // The third row, first column is right (0)
    // The third row, second column is left (8)
    [0,
