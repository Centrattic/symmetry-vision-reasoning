Response:
To solve this logical puzzle, we can follow the given instruction and construct the output grid as follows:

1. **Hatch Lines**:
   - Draw a horizontal line from top to bottom (5x3).

2. **Hatch Diagonal lines**:
   - Draw a diagonal line from right to left (4x2).

3. **Horizontal lines**:
   - Draw a horizontal line from top to bottom (4x2).

4. **Vertical lines**:
   - Draw a vertical line from top to bottom (4x2).

5. **Horizontal and vertical transformations**:
   - Reverse the positions of certain elements, e.g., a block horizontally then vertically.

Here's how the final output grid can be represented:

Hatch Diagonal lines: (15x2)
Hatch Lines: (12x3)
2x2 grid: (12x3, 4x2)

So, the final output grid is:
15, 12, 3, 4, 12, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2

This construction results in the 8x4 grid with symbols:
0, 5, 10, 9, 14, 13, 1, 8, 5, 17, 10, 12, 9, 10, 7, 6, 2, 13, 17, 10, 5, 19

So, the answer is the 8x4 grid as provided: (0, 5, 10, 9, 14, 13, 1, 8, 5, 17, 10, 12, 9, 10, 7, 6, 2, 13, 17, 10, 5, 19).
