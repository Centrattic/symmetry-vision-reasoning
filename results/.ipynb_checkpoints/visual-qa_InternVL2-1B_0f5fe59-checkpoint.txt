Response:
To construct the final output grid, we need to pick the height and width such that they form distinct 10x10 grids (including the empty space) and ensure that each vertical and horizontal axis has a different set of 2 symbols.

1. We start with choosing the height and width. The first 10x10 grid has the following configurations:
    - Vertical:
        - The top 10x10 grid has the black squares in row 2 rows, the white squares in row 5 rows, and 4 white squares in row 4 rows.
    - Horizontal:
        - The 10x10 grid has 9 rows with 1 entry each.
2. For the empty space, we use the following values:
    - For the top-left corner: we have 6 blue and 6 yellow squares.
    - For the top-right corner: we have 6 gray squares.

3. Constructing the final grid:
    - The top row could be 0, 8, 2, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 100, 128, 160. Notice that the number of blue squares is greater than the amount of yellow squares for the new 10x10 grid.
    - The second row could be 1, 9, 19, 29, 40, 60, 81, 120, 320, 640, 960. Again, the number of yellow squares exceeds the amount of blue squares.
    - The third row could be 0, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 37, 35, 30, 35. The yellow squares are equal to twice the amount of blue squares.
    - The fourth row could be 49, 47, 45, 50, 45, 45, 45. As the yellow squares do not exceed the blue squares.

Given these calculations, the final output grid will be:
```plaintext
0 8 2 16 32 48 64 80 100 128 160 100 160
1 19 29 40 60 81 123 163 120 120 123 100 125 120
0 7 10 15 28 35 35 150 450 4500 450 450 4500
1 7 10 15 28 35 150 450 4500 450 0
6 3 19 14 29 60 35 270 60 0 60
5 6 18 6 15 25 35 27 25 0
4 8 20 10 16 62 0 128 62 0 128
```

Each grid represents the final output based on the calculations above.
