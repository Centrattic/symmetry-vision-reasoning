Response:
To create the completed output grid, the following steps can be taken to represent the final result:

1. We have three distinct initial boxes:
    - The top-left box represents a vertical column.
    - The right-middle box represents a horizontal line.
    - The bottom-right box represents another vertical column.

2. We also have the following output symbols (integers 0 to 9, visualized as colors representing the symbol):
    - Yellow (1)
    - Red (U)
    - Green (T)
    - Blue without specific color symbol (0) - assumed here (a yellow box, which doesn't represent any symbol directly but a symbol representation of a cell)
    - Blue with purple:
       - Green (the left cell)
    - Green with yellow:
       - Light green (the right cell)
    - Purple square

3. Each cell in the output grid should be filled accordingly:

    Top: 
    - Vertical column: 1 (red 'U')
    - Horizontal line: 1 (yellow '1')
    - Vertical column: 1 (red 'U')
    - Horizontal line: 1 (yellow '1')

    Middle:
    - Vertical column: 1 (red 'U')
    - Horizontal line: 1 (yellow '1')
    - Vertical column: 2 (yellow '2')
    - Horizontal line: 1 (green '1')

    Bottom: 
    - Vertical column: 1 (blue '0')
    - Horizontal line: 2 (blue '2')
    - Vertical column: 1 (yellow '1')
    - Horizontal line: 2 (green '2')

    Final output grids:
    - Vertical column: [1, 2, 1, 2]
    - Horizontal line: [1, 1]
    - Vertical column: [1, 1, 2]
    - Horizontal line: [1, 2]

Therefore, the final output grid for the entire puzzle is:
1 1
1 2
1 1
2 2

Each integer corresponds to the symbols chosen in the initial grids.
