Response:
First, let's go through the image one row at a time, starting from the top-left corner. Then, each time we find a yellow square, pick 8 equal-sized numbers below it (which are also available in one second) and sum them up, and then put them onto the answer given below.

Starting from the top:

1. Yellow square: N/A
   For the height and width of each individual square:
2. Yellow square: F/N
   Then add 8 to the blue value:
   Total = blue - 8

3. Yellow square: F/N + 8

For further processing, note that the answer format may vary slightly depending on the coding language used, but here is the expected output for each number:

```python
def grid_transform(input):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(input)):
        total += input[i]
    new_grid = []

    for row in input:
        new_grid += [x + (row[row]) for x in input]

    for w in new_grid:
        new_grid[w] = [total // abs(x) // 8 + i // 8 + j for x in new_grid[0] and new_grid.index(x) != i and new_grid.index(x) != w]
        total_sum += len(new_grid[0]) // 8

    for row in new_grid[:-1]: # remove unnecessary zeros 
        row.pop(0) # remove topmost cells since they are not needed

    return new_grid
```

Example Output:
37
29
7
30
40
8
10
6
58
88
41
10
9

The last grid, with the solution and corresponding output, is:

Output:
```python
[37, 29, 7, 30, 40, 8, 10, 58, 88, 41, 10, 9]
```
