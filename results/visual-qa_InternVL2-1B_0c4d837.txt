Response:
There are several input and output patterns in the puzzle that can be extracted:

1. From left to right: When the input grid is filled vertically, the maximum value is inserted first.
   - At the top row: Purple (2)
   - Middle row: Yellow (4)
   - Bottom row: Yellow (2)
2. From left to right: When the input grid is filled horizontally:
   - The number above the selected upper cell is written vertically in the same color as the cell below it.
   - This ensures a 3x3 grid, which can be converted as `y = 2a`.
3. To construct the final output grid:

   There are multiple horizontal and vertical pairs that must fit into the final grid with some elements in a different order so
   - Fill up the spaces in a grid pattern that aligns with the input patterns.
4. We can apply these patterns to the final grid:

**Final output grid:**
(Start from top row row start)  -->  [blue (2), red 10, red 9, red 2, yellow 0] 
[green 2, green 1, green 2, green 1] 
[yellow 3, yellow 3, yellow 0, yellow 4]
[blue 4, blue 3, blue 2, blue 4]
Final row: [-1] 
*Note: The top row does not fit, so it is filled with -1 and the bottom row is filled with 0 for visual differentiation, assuming this grid is in the right order and visually aligned as per the guidelines.*

Therefore, the final output grid is:

```Grid: [[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [2, 4, 0, 1, 1], [3, 5, -1, -1, -1], [2, 1, 0, 1, 4], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]
```

Here are the detailed steps of the filling using specific patterns:

1. Fill blue:
   - Top row 3 (2, 0)
   - Middle row 1 (1, 1)
   - Bottom row 4 (1, 2)
2. Fill red:
   - Top row 1 (1, 2)
   - Middle row 0 (1, 0)
   - Bottom row 3 (1, 4)
*Note: The last color in the grid in the top row is black which does not fit into the grid since we need the patterns to adhere to right-side alignment.*
