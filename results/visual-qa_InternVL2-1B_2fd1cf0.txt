Response:
To solve this logic puzzle, we need to understand the transformation of the input grid (`input_grid`) and the symbols (`output_grid`) in both input and output grids.

1. InputGrid:
    - Rows sum to 9, columns sum to 9.
    - Blue is 3, Red is 2, White is 1, Gray is 1.
    
2. OutputGrid:
    - Rows sum to 9, columns sum to 9.
    - Blue is 1, Red is 1, White is 3, Gray is 0.
    
Now, let's construct the output grid using the given input and symbols:

1. **First Output Grid**:
    - Rows are: 4 (3 + 1 + 1). (1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1, 1) + 4 = 10 (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)
    - Columns are: 3 (3 > 0). (1 + 1 + 1) + 3 = 5 (1 + 1)
    - Hence, the output grid is [10, 5]. (0 + 1 + 3)

2. **Second Output Grid**:
    - Rows are: 2 (2 + 0) + 4 (4 + 1 + 1): 6 + 5 = 11 (2 + 4 + 1 + 1)
    - Columns are: 2 (2 > 0). (1 + 1 + 1) + 2 = 4 (1 + 1)
    - Hence, the output grid is [11, 4]. (0 + 1 + 1 + 1)

For the final output grid based on the transformation:
- InputGrid = [1, 3, 4] (blue + white + gray = 1 + 1 + 1)
- OutputGrid = [11, 11] (red + white + gray = 1 + 1 + 3)

Thus, the corresponding output grid is:
[11, 11]
