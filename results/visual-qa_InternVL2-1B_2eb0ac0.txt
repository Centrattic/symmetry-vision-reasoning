Response:
To solve this puzzle, we first need to understand how to transform the input grid into an output grid. The transformation involves finding the height and width of each cell in the input grid and then filling each cell with the corresponding symbol found in the output grid. Here's the breakdown:

1. Input grid cells, from left to right and top to bottom:
   ![Input Grid](https://via.placeholder.com/40x40)

2. Transformation grid cells, from left to right and top to bottom:
   ![Transformation](https://via.placeholder.com/40x40)

**Final Output Grid:**

Here are the cells corresponding to the output grid:
![Output Grid](https://via.placeholder.com/40x40

This grid reflects how the input grid cells might look in a more orderly state before the transformation. 

Hence, the final solution for the logic puzzle is:
```plaintext
[[Input Grid], [Transformation], [Output Grid]]
``` 
Where:
`Input Grid: ` -> `Output Grid:` corresponds to the transformation. 
Replace these placeholders with the output grid given above.
