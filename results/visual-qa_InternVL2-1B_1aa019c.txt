Response:
The first grid (top left) shows no squares. We start at the bottom left and move upwards to the top right. If we make this move, the squares at the new top and right corners will be moved to the new bottom and left corners, respectively (since there is only one unit of movement between move 1 and move 2). Therefore, the next move must start from (2,3) moving up to (7,10). Moving right is allowed by the puzzle's constraints (and by the initial position), so we can determine the next move: up to (7,13). The next move will bring the top right square to the top left, and the bottom right square will move diagonally to the top right. The steps are as follows:
    (2,3) → (7,13)
    (7,13) → (3,11)

Since we want all squares to have colors less than 9, we need to move upwards from each step. The resulting grid is as follows:

- (7,13) → (3,11)
  3 →
  6 →
  9 →
  12 → 15 → 17 → 21 → 26 → 31 → The grid is empty at the end.

The final grid is:

3 6 9 12 15 17 21 26 31 36 39 42

The output: [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, 21, 26, 31, 36, 39, 42]
