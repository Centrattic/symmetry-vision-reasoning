Response:
To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the color wheel to produce an output grid by following a certain sequence. We're looking for the transformation between the input (n-dimensional grid) and the final output (two-dimensional grid) given the input numbers and corresponding symbols. We need to follow these steps:

1. **Apply the color wheel transformations**:
   - The x-axis transformation maps the input to the color wheel.
   - The y-axis transformation maps the color wheel to the initial grid.

2. **Create the final output grid**:
   Using the color wheel and each given number, we can pick the appropriate height and width as shown in the image.

Let's execute these steps:

### Apply color wheel transformations:

#### x-axis (shift) transformation:
- The y-values will not change because the grid remains two-dimensional.
- The x-values will increase by the absolute difference between the input and the color wheel.

#### y-axis (shift) transformation:
- The height decreases by 1, so the new heights will be 2(2x - 2), 1(2x - 1), for all x values.
- The width increases by 1, so the new widths will be (2x + 1), (1+2x), for all x values.

Therefore, creating an output grid with the provided integer values:

| 4  |  -> a_1 (yellow) + 4
| 3  | +4, x+y -> a_2 (blue) + 3 (blue)
| 2  | +3, x-y -> a_3 (green) + 2 (green)
| 1  | +2, x-y -> a_4 (red) + 1 (red)
| 0  | +1, x-y -> a_5 (orange) + 0 (orange)

This yields the final grid:

| 2  | 1
| 0  | 10
|  4  | 8
|  2  |  7
|  0  |  9
|  4  |  5

Thus, the output grid with given integer values is:

```
array: [2, 1, 8, 7, 0, 10, 1, 9, 5]
```
