Response:
To solve this logic puzzle, we will input different values of three columns and output a grid determined by those inputs.

Let's look at each column:
- The top column looks the same:
  - 1, 2, 3
- The middle column:
  - 4, 5, 6
- The bottom column:
  - 7, 8, 9

Now, let's fill each row with the corresponding grid's symbol:
- Top row: (Rows 1 and 3 have the same symbol, so 6/6) = 1
- Middle row: (Rows 2 and 3 have the same symbol, so 5/6)
- Bottom row: (Rows 1 and 3 have the same symbol, so 4/6) = 4/6

Row by row, the output grid is:
```
1, 4, 7
2, 5, 8
3, 6, 2
6, 7, 3
```
