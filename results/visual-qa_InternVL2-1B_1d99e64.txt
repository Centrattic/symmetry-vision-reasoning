Response:
The grids used in this logic puzzle contain both blocks (red, black, white) and lines (blue and black). The goal is to transform these input grids into the output grid, and then to fill in each cell to make the total sum of the output equal to 21 (0, 0- 19, 0).

Here are the steps to solve the puzzle:

1. Transform each input grid into the output grid by picking the height and width and then applying the given symbols:

### Height and Width for Input Grides (Example):
- Input grid with 4 columns and 3 rows: 4 * 3
- Input grid with 5 columns and 2 rows: 5 * 2

2. Fill in the given symbols (represented by the colors blue and black) with corresponding numbers to make the sum equal to 21 (non-repeating):

- Fill in 0, 0:
  * For the first row, the sum is 10.
  * For the second row, the sum is 11.

- Fill in 0, 1:
  * For the first column, the sum is 10.
  * For the second column, the sum is 14.

- Fill in 0, 2:
  * For the first column, the sum is 12.
  * For the second column, the sum is 15.

- Fill in 0, 3:
  * For the first row, the sum is 11.
  * For the second row, the sum is 16.

- Fill in 0, 4:
  * For the first column, the sum is 10.
  * For the second column, the sum is 17.

- Fill in 0, 5:
  * For the first row, the sum is 9.
  * For the second row, the sum is 19.

Thus, the final output grid is represented by the following array:

[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 19]
