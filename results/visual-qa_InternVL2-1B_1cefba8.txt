Response:
Sure, let's solve this logic puzzle step by step:

1. **Input grid rules**:
   - The first column has a yellow square.
   - The second column has six yellow and green squares, including four large and four small.
   - The third row has a blue and red square, and a large yellow square.
   - The fourth column has six large black squares and a blue square on the left side.
   - The final row has three yellow squares, a large blue square, and a small square.

2. **Initial grids**:
```
[ [    0,   0], [   0,   0], [   0,  8], [0,      0], [  0,   0],
    [  0,  0!, 11], [  0,  0,  4], [  0,  6,  0], [ 0,   0], [   0],
 [0,   0,  0, 0], [5,  0, 0, 0], [0,  1,  0, 0], [0,  0,  0, 0], [0,  0,  0, 0],
 [0,  0,  0,  0], [0,  0,  0,  0], [0,  0,    0], [0,  0,  0,    0], [0,  0,  0,  0]
]

``` 
3. **Step one, fill the bottom row**:
   - First row: 0 +  0 = 2 (left empty yellow square, no filled color).
   - Second row: 0 +  2 = 2 (same as the top row).
   - Third row: 1 + 6 = 7 (no white).

   So, the cells in the bottom row: [0,2, 7].

4. **Step two, fill the middle row 9 to 0**:
   - The middle row starts with 7 (black empty space in the center).
   - Fill every cell horizontally and vertically.

   Resulting grid: 
   - Top row: 0 + 7 = 7 (yellow square below the first, two white spaces).
   - Bottom row: 2 + 0 = 2 (yarn row above)
   - Right row: 6 + 0 = 6 (white row above).
   - Bottom row: 7 + 6 = 13 (yellow above second row).

   So, the final grid is [7,2,13].

5. **Step three, fill the left part**:
   - First row: 0 + 0 = 0 + white.
   - Second row: 0 + 2 = 2.

   Resulting grid: [0, 2].

6. **Step four, fill the right part**:
   - Last row is the same without filling.

   So, the final grid is [0,2].

The output grid is:
```
[ [ 0,  0,  0,  0], [ 0,  0,  2,  2], [ 0,   0,  4,  0], [ 0,   0,  2,  2], [ 2,  0,  0,  0], [2,  0,  0,  0], [ 0,  0,  0,  0], [0,   2,  0,  2], [ 4,   0,  0,  0], [ 2,  0,  0,  0], [2,  0,  0,  0], [ 0,  0,  0,  0], [ 0,  0,  0,  0]]
