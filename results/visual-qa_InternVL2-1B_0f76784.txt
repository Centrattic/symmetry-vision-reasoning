Response:
To solve the image:

1. Identify the rows where two figures meet: a bottom row (6 squares) and a top row.

2. Identify the intersection points between the squares. 
    - Each figure in the bottom row intersects with each figure in the top row exactly once and in pairs.

3. Ensure each square in the bottom row (6 squares) is equal to its pair (the top row figure) and vice versa. This will require selecting pairs.
    - For example, if the leftmost grid is 1 3 2 4 0 9 5, select 0 5.
    - Verify that the values of each number add up to the total number of squares in the cell, which should be a number between 1 and 9.

So, the possible output grid:

Bottom row:
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6

Top row (pairs):
  6 5 4 3 6 2 1

Finally, the empty grid is assigned to the 'a' input square (top right):

Output: [6, 5, 4, 3, 6, 2, 1]
