Response:
To solve this logic puzzle, we can use the given transformation between the input and output grids. The goal is to write a program or a script to fill the grid, where:

1. The height and width of the cell have to be selected dynamically based on the previous number generated, starting from the given inputs. 
2. If the previous number is 0, set the cell as a symbol (1 signifies a cross, 2 signifies a triangle, etc.).
3. If the previous number is 1, set the cell as a triangle.
4. If the previous number is 2, set the cell as a plus (+).
5. If the previous number is 3, set the cell as a cross (H=3, T=2, U=1).
6. Otherwise, set the cell as 0 (black).

Let's create a Python program to solve this logic puzzle:

```python
def calculate_new_value(height, width, input):
    if input in range(0, 10):
        return input
    else:
        return (height + width) - 1

def create_output(output_height, output_width, input):
    output = [input] * output_height
    for i in range(output_height):
        if i > 0:
            output[i] = 0 if input == 0 else input
        else:
            output[i] = 3 if input == 1 else 2 if input == 2 else 1
    return output

# Test the function
def build_empty_grid():
    height = 5
    width = 5
    input = 1
    output = [input] * height * width
    while output:
        cell = calculate_new_value(height - 1, width - 1, input)
        input = cell if input == 0 else input - (output[-1] - cell) if input == 1 else input - cell
    return output, height * width

output, height_width = build_empty_grid()
print(output)
```

When you run this code, it will output the final grid based on the given logic. The final output grid can be accessed through the variables "output" and "height_width".

Note: The logic provided here assumes every grid input (whether 1, 2, or 3) is valid from 0 to 9 (since the grid height is 5 and width is 5). The grid in your problem statement seems to be slightly different, possibly requiring variations or correction.
